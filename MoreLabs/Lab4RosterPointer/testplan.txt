Test Plan Week 3:
First test we made sure we could add,remove, and list all work properly.
for that we used actual test names.
Then we overloaded the array to test error functions for capacity
Then we tested if an error was thrown if we tried to remove an id that did not exist.
We tested if what is thrown if we insert an ID that is already in the code (copy ID)

Revisions to test plan for Lab 4:
Test max for the roster. Makesure no memory leaks.
Test over 30 students since that was the old capacity
The roster should be able to add as many items as possible
All test cases from last week should still work, except you should be able to add as many 
students as wanted
